/// The proof demonstrates that a committed polynomial evaluates to a specific value
/// at a given point. It consists of messages from the interactive protocol made
/// non-interactive via Fiat-Shamir.
///
/// The proof includes the matrix dimensions (nu, sigma) used during proof generation,
/// which the verifier uses to ensure consistency with the evaluation point.
